### 🎨 Visual & Audio Polish

### 🎮 Gameplay Features

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- [x] Debugging utility: press ~ (tilde) to turn on visual debugging with thin
      lines.
    - [x] Draw the collision circles around objects (magenta)
    - [x] For AOE weapons, render their AOE range as a circle (cyan)
    - [x] For directed weapons, render their range as a line extending from the
          ship in the direction the projectiles would fire, and terminating at the
          edge of that weapon's range (cyan)

#### Physics Testing Foundation (for future gravity system)

- [ ] Add physics unit tests as foundation for future gravity system refactor
- [ ] Create baseline physics behavior tests (ship movement, bullet inheritance, collision)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for physics calculations with many entities

#### General

- [ ] Performance optimizations for large numbers of objects
