# Blasteroids Development TODO

### üé® Visual & Audio Polish

- [ ] Implement ship trails/afterimage effect

### üéÆ Gameplay Features

- [x] Weapon mechanics: different weapons, each with their own upgrades

    - [x] Lasers!
        - [x] Keyboard shortcut: 3
        - [x] Firing emits a solid beam, like a laser sword, but it is not very long
        - [x] It drains fuel quickly (7 units/sec, reduced by 30% from original design)
        - [x] Gift Upgrade: 50% longer range
        - [x] Gift Upgrade: 50% more efficient fuel usage
        - [x] Instant hit-scan beam with line-circle collision detection
        - [x] Multi-layer visual rendering with glow effects
        - [x] Sci-fi audio effects with frequency modulation
        - [x] Auto-switch to newly acquired weapons
    - [x] Lightning
        - [x] Keyboard shortcut: 4
        - [x] An electrical arc will zap the nearest object in a circle around the ship
        - [x] Consumes 8 fuel per shot with 1.5 second cooldown
        - [x] 60 pixel base radius for target finding
        - [x] Gift Upgrade: 20% larger radius
        - [x] Gift Upgrade: Chain lightning jumps to additional targets (max 3 total)
        - [x] Animated jagged electrical arcs with glow effects
        - [x] Electrical crackling sound effects with frequency modulation
        - [x] Muffled "urk" sound when no targets in range (no fuel consumed)
        - [x] Only consumes fuel and cooldown when valid target found

- [x] **Repulsor Beam**: Asteroid fragments now fly away from ship instead of toward it
    - [x] 40% bias away from ship position with 60% randomness
